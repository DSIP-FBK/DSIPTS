# DSIPTS: unified library for timeseries modelling

This library allows to:
1- load timeseries in a convenient format
2- create tool timeseries with controlled categorical features (additive and multiplicative)
3- load public timeseries
4- train a predictive model using different pytroch architectures

##How to

In a pre-generated environment install pytorch and pytorch-lightning (`pip install pytorch-lightning`) 

``
python setup.py install --force
